Males show significantly lower reported frequency of depression symptoms than females (the reference group) On average 2.92 fewer men (β = -2.92, p &lt; 0.0001) report symptoms of depression compared to women. The intercept (24.12) represents the average number of women that report frequency of depression symptoms. The p-value for the male subgroup is very small (p = 0.000066, p &lt; 0.05). This indicates biological sex differences are highly unlikely to be due to chance."

If you decide on a private repository, make sure you share it with me (my GitHub handle is picoral)\nClick “Create repository”: Once you’ve filled in the details, click the “Create repository” button to finalize the process.\n\nAdd your files to your repository:\n\nClick to open your repository\nClick on Add File (top right of your repo file listing), then choose Upload Files\nDrag the files you want to add to your repo\nScroll down and click on Commit changes\n\n\nIf I am unable to access your repository to see your files, your grade will be zero.\n\n\nData\nYou will choose your your data source. Here are some options where you can find data:\n\nhttps://data.gov/\nhttps://data.europa.eu/en\nhttps://data.un.org\nhttps://data.worldbank.org\nhttps://www.who.int/data\n\nYou should create a .qmd file for your final project with your code and your data description. Make sure to describe all variables in our data.\n\n\nQuestion\nYou should answer at least two (2) questions. Formulate those questions and write them out in your .qmd file.\n\n\nDescriptive Analysis\n\nCreate at least one histogram of one of your numeric variables.\nCreate at least one boxplot of one of your numeric variables (add a categorical variable to it)\nOptionally, if you have two numeric variables, create a scatterplot plot of both variables\nSummarize your data – calculate mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of at least one numeric variable by a group\n\n\n\nInferential Statistics\n\nRun two sample t-test, ANOVA, correlation, or linear regression to answer your questions\nVisualize, interpret and write out results\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nSummarize what you did for your analysis and your findings in two paragraphs"
