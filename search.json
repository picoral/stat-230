You can name your data frame (what we call the data that has been loaded into R) anything you want, but you should choose meaningful names.\n\nWe will often save the data file to our computer first, and then read the data in from the file you have in our project. That way if the file does not exist anymore at that web address, you can still used.\nHere’s how we go about doing that:\n\nCreate a new folder in your project called data – you can do that by clicking on the New Folder icon at the top of the Files panel\nDownload the data and drag and drop the gpa_study_hours.csv file into the data folder you created\nChange the read_csv function call in your first.R document to: gpa_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/gpa_study_hours.csv\")"
